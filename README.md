# Why need Personal Portfolio-Website ?
here is the Answer , I worked on projects like game development in Unreal Engine 5.6.1 and i created an open world games and its file size exceeds the github repositories (tens of GBs) so,it's not possible for me to showcase my projects . so, im creating my own website where anyone can download the games and play it on their respective systems.

I used Spline for interactive robot present in the home page , also used AOS ( Animation on scroll).
